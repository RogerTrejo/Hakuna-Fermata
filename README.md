# Description
In this project, I created a loopable music piece that changes its scale by a small alteration every iterable and creates a nice melody to read a book to, relax, sleep, or just listen to for fun!
My inspiration was finding a tune that could get me more focused but also allowing some background noise to come and be heard while doing work. So although this music piece is loopable, it still creates enough alteration so the piece resembles more of a journey instead of just repeating the same notes. This is ideal because you can keep the nice repeating tones by only having changed the tone through the scales.

Song moment is suppose to go through a small intro which gradually changes through the iterations and then as that intro becomes the chorus for the song, we transition with chords into a fitting scale which also changed from each iteration so as to feel more like a different tune but still has the same relaxing melody to it.
