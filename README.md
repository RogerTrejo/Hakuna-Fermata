# Description
In this project, I created a loopable music piece that changes its scale by a small alteration every iterable and creates a nice melody to read a book to, relax, sleep, or just listen to for fun!
My inspiration was finding a tune that could get me more focused but also allowing some background noise to come and be heard while doing work. So although this music piece is loopable, it still creates enough alteration so the piece resembles more of a journey instead of just repeating the same notes. This is ideal because you can keep the nice repeating tones by only having changed the tone through the scales.
