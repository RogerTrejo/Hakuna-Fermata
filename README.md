Relaxing Music piece created for enjoyment purposes using Sonic Pi

# Project name: relaxing-wave
# Description
In this project, I created a loopable music piece that changes its scale by a small alteration every iterable and creates a nice melody to read a book to, relax, sleep, or just listen to for fun!
My inspiration was finding a tune that could get me more focused but also allowing some background noise to come and be heard while doing work.
